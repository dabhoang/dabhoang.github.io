<h2>Collect</h2>
	<p>I created a text based game in Java where the user traverses through multiple cities on an island with anonymous highways to collect as many points as possible. To determine the connectivity of the cities and the shortest distance to each of the items, I used the breadth first search algorithm.</p>
<h2>freeBay</h2>
	<p>I worked with a team of 6 to create a mobile app using Android Studio and SCRUM methodology where users can post their unwanted items to give away.</p>
<h2>Personal Website</h2>
	<p>I created a personal website to display my professional background using HTML and CSS.</p>
